###1 Got ideas?

Create Blog as visual brainstorm, a list of ideas and changes to the Scribus UI. We should collect everybody's contributions Scribus UI design. It is moderated by the Scribus UI consisting of people who commit to a long term work on the Scribus UI.We do not only post mock-ups ourselves, but also "listen" to what you show us and broaden our horizons. (Should we create the blog on a trendy platform? g+? tumblr?)

What happens with the ideas? We can't promise that any of your ideas will be implemented, but each of them will contribute in the exploration of the ways Scribus should go in the future.

Some rules:

- The focus is not on ideas for new features, but on improving the user interaction of Scribus.
- Explain your idea in a few images. A text explanation can be attached, but it would be nice if the images can speak by themselves. Images must be in PNG or animaged GIF format.
- Your images should show your idea in a clear way, but they don’t have to be glossy and polished. Plain vector drawings or even scanned pencil sketches should also work.
- Send your image to us, put the word "Scribus GUI" in the title of your email;
- Tell us if and how you want to be credited for your contribution.
- Explain your idea. Keep it short, point out what is innovative. If you feel you need a lot of text to explain, it may be a sign that your idea may need some more work (or that you are trying to solve too many problems in one move)
- Please avoid polemics.
- If you want to respond to a contribution, by all means, take the image, modify it with your own ideas and send it back to the brainstorm. Be careful to attribute the contributor(s) who worked before on that image.
- All contribution must be compatible with the the CC BY SA and GPL licenses of this blog and the Scribus software.

### 2 The Team

    We were a loose team that keep in touch over the internet and get together once a year at the Libre Graphics Meeting. Our core team is composed by:
- Ale Rimoldi
- Cédric Gémy
- Claudia Krummenacher
- Louis Desjardins
- Silvia Schiaulini
- Vladimir Savic

### 3 Product vision

Through all the discussions with the core developers and some of the power users we have created a product vision for Scribus:

- Scribus is Free Software;
- Scribus is a DTP program producing PDF that will be printed on professional presses;
- Scribus is created for professional users;
- Scribus creates Brochures, Leaflets and Posters

The users:

- Communication professionals</li>
- TODO: ...</li>

### 4 Functionality overview

To design something, you need to know everything it is suppose to do.

TODO: Create a functionlity overview like http://gui.gimp.org/images/b/b2/GIMP_functionality.pdf but shorter)

### 5 User scenarios

(prepare a list of user scenarios and evaluate for each feature needed how good scribus is and what can be improved)</p>

- Professional graphics designer creating a template for a quarterly magazine for an association
  - create a new file
  - create the cover
  - ... (define all the steps)
- Creating a weekly magazine with professional writers and layouters
- Creating a monthly magazine with unexperiences writers and layouters
- Communication professional creating a threefold leaflet
- IT professional creating a script for mail merging
- Creating a catalog

### 6 Evaluation notes

TODO: To evaluate Scribus functionality we want to go through our six user scenarios. We will focus on functionality that support users to achieve their goals, while executing these essential tasks.

### 7 Analysis

TODO: An analysis of Scribus, element by element (is it really useful?)
