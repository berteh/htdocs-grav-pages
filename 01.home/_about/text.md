Scribus has three major strengths: fast creation; easy organization; and simple production. A particularly great feature of Scribus is the flexibilty you have when you are creating your documents. From a design perspective, this is a big advantage since, in a short amount of time, you can experiment with a variety of graphical and typographic options including: fonts; colors; shading; transparency; visual effects; typographic parameters; position and rotation of the elements. These options are easily accessible and intuitive.

Don't just stare at a blank page, let Scribus help you bring it to life.
