In some distributions, Scribus 1.5.4 (or 1.5.5svn) can be obtained from your package manager as "scribus-ng".

In some distributions, only Scribus 1.5.4 is packaged as "scribus":

- Gentoo,
- Arch.

For Ubuntu a [PPA is available](https://launchpad.net/~scribus/+archive/ppa?target=_blank)

For the documentation, you will probably need to activate the "Non Free" Repository.
