## Nightly Development Versions

We provide _nightly_ snapshots that are based on the current code.

Most of the time, development snapshots are of high quality and _older_ features shold be as robust as in the stable version: but be careful when using new features!

Uasge of unstable versions for other goals than testing is at your own risk.  
Unstable developer snapshots can corrupt files of stable versions and can make them unusable.
