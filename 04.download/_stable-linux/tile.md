In most distributions, Scribus 1.4.8 can be obtained from the official repositories and is named "scribus".

Packages are are known to exist for:

- Debian, Ubuntu (.deb)
- CentOS, Fedora, RedHat Enterprise Linux, SUSE and OpenSUSE (.rpm:)
- Gentoo
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD

If you want to also get the documentation, you will probably need to activate the "Non Free" Repository and look for the "scribus-doc" package.

Some "bleeding edge" distribution only package the development version. If you don't feel comfortable with using it, you need to compile Scribus.
